An opinionated CLI to transcribe Audio files (or YouTube videos) w/ Whisper on-device! Powered by *MLX*, *Whisper* & *Apple M series*

**TL;DR** - After our actual testing, the Whisper supported by MPS achieves speeds comparable to a 4090!

80 mins audio file only need 80s on APPLE M1 MAX 32G! ONLY 80 SECONDS

## üÜï Blazingly fast transcriptions via your terminal! ‚ö°Ô∏è

We've added a CLI to enable fast transcriptions. Here's how you can use it:

Install `whisper-mps` with `pip`:

```bash
# please install ffmpeg first: brew install ffmpeg
pip install whisper-mps
```

Run inference from any path on your computer:

```bash
# filetype should be wav/mp3/mp4 etc.
whisper-mps --file-name <filename>
```

Run inference with a specific model size:

```bash
# for example, using the base model size. Other available models: "tiny", "base", "small", "medium", "large".
# Larger models require more loading time.
# filetype should be wav/mp3/mp4 etc.
whisper-mps --file-name <filename> --model-name base
```

Run inference from a YouTube URL on your computer:

> [!NOTE]
> **Deprecated:** The YouTube URL inference feature is deprecated and may be removed in future releases.  
> Please uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to download YouTube videos.

```bash
# whisper-mps --youtube-url https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=jaM02mb6JFM
```

> [!NOTE]
> The CLI is highly opinionated and only works on Apple MPS.
